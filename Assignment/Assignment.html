	  The club was set up this year by a of group students to provide a fun outlet for MTU students. During the Lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, students needed to find a way to stay busy.
	  This is where the idea for Balloon Keepy Uppy club originated. The game went viral with challenges being posted on social media apps such as TikTok. Many students took part 
	  in these challenges to ease the lockdown boredom. Students found themselves thoroughly enjoying the game and wanting to expand into the world of team sport.
	  The game has grown from strength to strength and teams have been set up in universities nationwide! The first Balloon Keepy Uppy World Cup was held this year in Spain. 
	  After a thrilling tournament Peru beat South American rivals Argentina in the final and took home the win!
